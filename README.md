**Panorama Stitching Using Computer Vision**

**Project Overview:**\
This project focuses on implementing a panorama stitching algorithm to merge multiple images into seamless panoramic views.

**Project Highlights:**
1. Feature Detection and Description: Using SIFT for accurate and invariant feature extraction.
2. Feature Matching: Using KNN with cross-validation for reliable matching.
3. Homography Estimation: Using RANSAC to align images and manage outliers.
4. Panorama Creation: Supports horizontal and vertical stitching of multiple images.
5. Comparison with OpenCV: Evaluate the performance of custom-implemented algorithms against OpenCV's built-in methods.

**Datasets**\
The project uses public images for testing the stitching algorithm. Below is an example:
